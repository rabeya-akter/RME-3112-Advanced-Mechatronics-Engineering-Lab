## 🔬 Experiments Conducted

1. **Mapping surrounding structures and shapes using LIDAR**  
   Experimented on mapping surrounding structures using LIDAR, demonstrating how varying RPM affects the clarity of 2D maps generated by a basic LIDAR system.

2. **Dynamic characteristics of PD controller**  
   Explored the dynamic characteristics of a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller using a PID Control Trainer Kit, demonstrating its step response and analog behavior through oscilloscope observations.  

3. **Controlling DC motor and counting rotation using PLC**  
   Demonstrated the use of a PLC and ladder logic to control a DC motor and count its rotations, showcasing how industrial automation tasks can be effectively executed and monitored through programmable systems.

4. ** Dynamic Characteristics of PID, PD and PI using MATLAB Simulator**  
   Investigated the dynamic characteristics of PI, PD, and PID controllers using MATLAB simulations, illustrating their time response behaviors through transfer functions and corresponding output graphs.
   
5. **LED Blinking using STM32 Micro-controller**  
   Experimented the blinking of an LED using bare-metal programming on an STM32 microcontroller, highlighting GPIO configuration, register handling, and code deployment via Keil uVision.
  
6. ** Programming a PLC trainer to sort metallic cylinders based on their height**  
   Programmed a PLC to sort metallic cylinders by height using ladder logic and a conveyor-based setup and successfully demonstrated industrial automation and control through sensor-based decision-making.
